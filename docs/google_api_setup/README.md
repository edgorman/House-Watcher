# Google API

To run the google api module, you must have an account setup at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). This must be done before the project and API key setup below.

## Project and API Key Instructions.

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. Create a new project, and give it a name.

3. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).

4. Click the 'Places API', which should be under Maps.

5. Enable the API, and click 'Manage'.

6. Click 'Credentials' in the left hand sidebar.

7. Click 'Create Credentials' at the top of the page, and select 'API Key'.

8. Copy and save your API key to a text file and name it 'key.txt'

9. Place the text file in 'property-fundamentals/google_api/'.

And you're all done! I've configured the github repo such that this file won't be uploaded to the internet. Make sure you keep a copy somwehere, in case you delete/lose your local files.
